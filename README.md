### Telemetry

Pop CLI collects anonymous usage metrics to help us understand how the tool is being used and how we can improve it.
We do not collect any personal information. If you wish to disable telemetry
or read more about our telemetry practices please see
our [telemetry](crates/pop-telemetry/README.md) documentation.

## Documentation

On the [Pop Docs website](https://learn.onpop.io) you will find:

## Building Pop CLI locally

Build the tool locally with all the features:

```sh
cargo build --all-features
```

Build the tool only for Parachain functionality:

```sh
cargo build --no-default-features --features parachain
```

Build the tool only for Smart Contracts functionality:

```sh
cargo build --no-default-features --features contract
```

## Testing Pop CLI

To test the tool locally. Due to the time it can take to build a Parachain or a Smart Contract, some tests have been
separated from the normal testing flow into integration tests.

Run the unit tests only:

```sh
cargo test --lib
```

To run the integration tests relating to Smart Contracts:

```sh
cargo test --test contract
```

To run the integration tests relating to Parachains:

```sh
cargo test --test parachain
```

Run all tests (unit + integration):

```sh
cargo test
```
